## Overview  
*Sheet Music Maker* is sheet music editing software with a community aspect to it. A user can share their works with any other user that follows them and vise versa. This application was my final project for my full-stack bootcamp and was made to showcase my skills learned up to this point, especially with React. It is still in its early stages and its editing capabilities are limited to simply adding quarter notes, erasing notes and editing text on the page.
